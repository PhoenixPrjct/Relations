Would PROJECT_NAME have any interest in discussing an opportunity to become an Affiliate of Prjct Phoenix?

## Details of what a Prjct Phoenix Affiliate looks like: ##

Basically, our DAO will be comprised of NFT holders from our Founder and Member mints as well as Affiliate Projects (this is where PROJECT_NAME could fit in) and Saved By Fire Projects.

The way the DAO permissions are set up, only Founder holders can write proposals directly.

As far as voting goes, it's a weighted system that is constructed as follows:
(exact weights are still being discussed internally, but it will likely be something like what's below)

-Founder vote weight =  7

-Member vote weight = 4

-Affiliate vote weight = 2

-Saved By Fire vote weight = 1 vote

**Example:**
```
Proposal A is created.
During it's open period:
1x Founder and 1x Saved by Fire vote for it
1x Member and 1x Affiliate vote against
Proposal A passes - 8 FOR | 6 AGAINST
```
So this is all to say if PROJECT_NAME became an Affiliate, EACH PROJECT_NAME NFT would have vote weight of 2 on all Prjct Phoenix DAO matters. Additionally, as we develop our Flock of Flames web apps we would selectively add the PROJECT_NAME Hash Table to the auth module (allowing PROJECT_NAME holder's to use the app for free for life).

Obviously, as you would be our first affiliate, we will likely include PROJECT_NAME in almost all of these apps.

I know this is a long message, but I just want to make sure I cover everything so you know what the proposal is at the end -- I'll summarize the idea at the end. ðŸ¤£ sorry.

In exchange, we would want PROJECT_NAME to add 2 wallet addresses to the creators meta on the NFTs.

The first would be for a wallet that we will have set up for monthly airdrops of revenue to holders of Founder,Member,Affiliate, and Saved By Fire NFTs.

The second would be for the Phoenix DAO wallet directly.

The picture attached is for clarity. Obviously, all numbers are completely fabricated -- just provided to illustrate what the process would look like.

In this hypothetical, PROJECT_NAME has agreed to 10% allocation to Phoenix (this would be 1% of secondary volume as it would be 10% of 10%)

## TL;DR: ##

Are you interested in having PROJECT_NAME have voting rights and other perks associated with Prjct Phoenix in exchange for a percentage of your secondary market being allocated to provide value to Phoenix DAO?

### Highlights: ##

#### Idea behind the proposal: ####

Current PROJECT_NAME Holders will be exposed to Prjct Phoenix in a positive way and will likely buy more NFTs under the Prjct Phoenix umbrella, if Prjct Phoenix is successful, people will see PROJECT_NAME as a strategic entry point to get DAO access-- thus driving more PROJECT_NAME secondary sales => more SOL being added to the DAO wallet and direct SOL airdrops associated with being a Prjct Phoenix/Affiliate Holder.

Conversely, Prjct Phoenix Holders will likely be inclined to buy PROJECT_NAME NFTs off secondary to acquire a larger revenue share and DAO votes.

#### Utility/Value Added to PROJECT_NAME: ####

    -Weighted vote in PhoenixDAO

    -Revenue share from other Affiliates and self secondary

    -Access to Flock of Flames Apps as they're developed
